## Scope

The scope of the Bug Bounty program spans smart contracts utilized in the Yearn ecosystem – the Solidity and/or Vyper smart contracts in the `contracts` folder of the `master` branch of the yearn-vaults [repo](https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-vaults), including historical deployments that still see active use on Ethereum Mainnet associated with YFI, and excluding any contracts used in a test-only capacity (including test-only deployments).

Note: Other contracts, outside of the ones mentioned above, might be considered on a case by case basis, please, reach out to the Yearn development team for clarification.
